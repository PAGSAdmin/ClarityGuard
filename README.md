Built by one woman who got tired of the noise.

### The problem
Every day we drown in headlines, memes, and posts designed to scare, divide, or confuse us — often in under 280 characters.

### What we know
- Real emergencies get buried under noise.  
- People want clarity fast, but fact-checkers are slow and corporate tools hide more than they reveal.  
- Most of us just want to know: *Is this actually important? And what’s the real truth?*


## License & Future

ClarityGuard is released under the **MIT License** (see LICENSE file) — 

A provisional patent application (US 63/845,773) covering the Population Impact Factor (PIF) methodology was filed in July 2025. The entire project, including the provisional patent, is available for acquisition.

Until acquisition, ClarityGuard remains 100% free, open-source, and community-driven under MIT.

Truth with heart
