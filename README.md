Built by one woman who got tired of the noise.

### The problem
Every day we drown in headlines, memes, and posts designed to scare, divide, or confuse us — often in under 280 characters.

### What we know
- Real emergencies get buried under noise.  
- People want clarity fast, but fact-checkers are slow and corporate tools hide more than they reveal.  
- Most of us just want to know: *Is this actually important? And what’s the real truth?*
