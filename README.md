Every single output is identical for the same story — reproducible truth, every time.

Works in Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — no login, no cost.

Built by one woman who got tired of the noise.

### The problem
Every day we drown in headlines, memes, and posts designed to scare, divide, or confuse us — often in under 280 characters.

### What we know
- Real emergencies get buried under noise.  
- People want clarity fast, but fact-checkers are slow and corporate tools hide more than they reveal.  
- Most of us just want to know: *Is this actually important? And what’s the real truth?*

### What ClarityGuard does
In 3 seconds it turns any messy post into calm, human truth.

**Example — before & after**

**Messy headline**  

“NEW STUDY: Eating one apple a day exposes you to dangerous levels of cyanide from the seeds. Apple seeds contain arsenic-like poison. Doctors warn: stop giving apples to children!”
