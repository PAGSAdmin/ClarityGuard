# ClarityGuard — a free truth quantifying tool forever
Created by PAGS ❤️

**The problem**  
Every day we drown in headlines, memes, and posts designed to scare, divide, or confuse us — often in under 280 characters.

**What we know**  
- Real emergencies (thousands affected, lives lost) get buried under opinion and noise.  
- People want clarity fast, but fact-checkers are slow and corporate tools hide more than they reveal.  
- Most of us just want to know: *Is this actually important? And what’s the real truth?*

**What we don’t know (and what’s still controversial)**  
- Which stories are life-or-death vs. just loud opinions?  
- How much risk is “a little” poison, “some” cigarettes, or “100 cigarettes in a lifetime”?  
- Who to trust when everyone claims to have “the facts”?

**What ClarityGuard does**  
In 3 seconds, it turns any messy post or headline into calm, human truth.

### The 9 buckets — how ClarityGuard sorts the entire internet
| Bucket       | What it catches                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact       | Real people counted — deaths, injuries, disasters     |
| Politics     | Power, law, war, elections                            |
| Understanding| Anything humans want to understand better (health, science, parenting, history, tech, food, psychology…) |
| Analysis     | “Study says”, percentages, data drops                 |
| Fun          | Joy, jokes, memes, sports, celebration                |
| Jabber       | All-caps rants                                        |
| Blabber      | Conspiracies                                          |
| Sour         | Classic dose/toxin fallacies                          |
| None         | Pure gibberish (almost never used)                    |

### Example — before & after
**Messy headline**  
“NEW STUDY: Eating one apple a day exposes you to dangerous levels of cyanide from the seeds. Apple seeds contain arsenic-like poison. Doctors warn: stop giving apples to children!”

**ClarityGuard output**  
Speaking Head Paraphrase: Claim that apple seeds are dangerous because of cyanide.  
Chart Increasing Insight: You’d need to chew ~200 seeds (20 apples) in one sitting for any risk.  
Speaking Head One breath, one truth: Truth: dose makes the poison.  
Yellow Circle Grade: B · Collect: #Health:Diet:Apples ✨  
Magnifying Glass tilted left Learn more → “How many apple seeds to reach toxicity?”  

*Verdict: You just neutralised a viral fear headline. ClarityGuard applied the dose-makes-the-poison rule and turned panic into calm.*
