# ClarityGuard — a free truth quantifying tool forever ❤️
Created by PAGS

### The problem
Every day we drown in headlines, memes, and posts designed to scare, divide, or confuse us — often in under 280 characters.

### What we know
- Real emergencies get buried under noise.  
- People want clarity fast, but fact-checkers are slow and corporate tools hide more than they reveal.  
- Most of us just want to know: *Is this actually important? And what’s the real truth?*

### What ClarityGuard does
In 3 seconds it turns any messy post into calm, human truth.

**Example — before & after**

**Messy headline**  
“NEW STUDY: Eating one apple a day exposes you to dangerous levels of cyanide from the seeds. Apple seeds contain arsenic-like poison. Doctors warn: stop giving apples to children!”

**ClarityGuard in 3 seconds**  
Speaking Head Paraphrase: Claim that apple seeds are dangerous because of cyanide.  
Chart Increasing Insight: You’d need to chew ~200 seeds (20 apples) in one sitting for any risk.  
Speaking Head One breath, one truth: Truth: dose makes the poison.  
Yellow Circle Grade: B · Collect: #Health:Diet:Apples ✨  
Magnifying Glass tilted left Learn more → “How many apple seeds to reach toxicity?”

*Verdict: You just neutralised a viral fear headline. ClarityGuard applied the dose-makes-the-poison rule and turned panic into calm.*

### How to use (5 seconds)
**Option 1 — one-liner (copy-paste into Grok/ChatGPT/Claude)**  
```python
import requests; print(requests.post("https://clarityguard.onrender.com/run", json={"text":"your story here"}).text)
