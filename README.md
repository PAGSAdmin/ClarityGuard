# ClarityGuard: The Narrative Firewall

**Evidence First. Noise Last. Clarity Wins.**

ClarityGuard is an open-source clarity lens that works with **any** AI and **any** device.

It doesn’t censor — it clarifies.

Born from 40 years of real-world admin grit and storytelling smarts, it turns any short post or headline into **actionable truth** in seconds:

- Real impacts that demand attention  
- Stories that spark honest “aha!” without spin  
- Noise flagged (never banned) so free speech thrives

Badges, scores, and one-tap context — so you see the real issue instantly.

Open-source. Works everywhere.

Truth with heart

## Built for Anyone Who Needs Clarity — Fast, Honest, Human

- Parents — cut through fear headlines about kids & screens  
- Patients — weigh medical claims before the next appointment  
- Voters — see policy impact, not just politics  
- Students — separate fact from spin in research  
- Journalists — pre-publish sanity check  
- Coders & analysts — turn noise into structured insight  
- Curious humans — ask any question, get the gist

No feed takeover.  
No censorship.  
Just one tap of context — for any story, anywhere.

## What Counts as a “Story”?

Any bite-sized text (max ~300 words / 2,000 characters):

- X posts · Headlines · Meme captions  
- Tweet threads (first few)  
- Random copy-paste claims

Longer than that? Just grab the juicy sentence.  
Built for the wild feed — not dusty journals or 500-page novels.

## Novelty Statement

Pre-read this to understand ClarityGuard's groundbreaking approach before diving in!

Rooted in 40 years of admin expertise, ClarityGuard delivers an innovative framework incorporating best practices from pre-computer and AI eras, restoring them in this new age to establish clarity in social media chaos. It processes posts, offering a novel starting point to define “real” news as Impact Shield for tangible events, while all other news falls under Story Sentinel (Politics, Understanding, Analysis, Fun), with Noise Neutralizer (JABBER, BLABBER, SOUR, MISC) as non-news for research.

**Open-Source for All:** ClarityGuard is MIT-licensed and free forever—no ads, no tracking, no platform lock-in. Fork it, build on it, use it anywhere. It's designed for anyone who needs clarity, not just X users. Grok-ready as an optional power-up, but works with any AI or device.

Truth with heart ❤️

## Core Pillars (The Guard’s Layers)

1. **Impact Shield**  
   Spots verifiable real-world hits: floods closing roads, shutdowns stranding commuters, parades uniting crowds.  
   Badges: **! EMERGENCY WARNING** (haptic buzz for disasters, cross-checked via NOAA/AP/RSS).  
   Why it guards: Anchors truth in data — only high-confidence events break through.

2. **Story Sentinel**  
   Surfaces narrative gold:  
   - POLITICS debates  
   - UNDERSTANDING deep dives  
   - **ANALYSIS** (models & studies) → **★ POLICY LENS**  
   - FUN connectors (memes, festivals)  

   Badges: **★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA!** for stories that shift perspectives.  
   Why it guards: Turns chaos into connection — gives every real story a fair hearing, no spin.

3. **Noise Neutralizer** (JBSM)  
   Catches clutter:  
   - JABBER (venting rants)  
   - BLABBER (conspiracies & speculation)  
   - SOUR (hoaxes & proven false)  
   - MISC (pure weird / nonsense)  

   Badges: **★ MISLEADING** (unverified claims)  

   Why it guards: Flags junk without deleting or muting — keeps the feed readable while protecting free speech.

   ## Scoring: The Guard’s Lie Detector

ClarityGuard never guesses. Every story gets three transparent scores — so you can judge the verdict yourself.

| Score          | What it measures                              | How it’s calculated (exact weights)                                 | Range & meaning                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Grade**      | **Trustworthiness** of the information       | 40 % source quality<br>30 % precision (exact vs vague)<br>20 % corroboration<br>10 % recency (within 24 h = full points) | **A+** ≥ 95 % – gold standard<br>**A** 90–94 %<br>**B** 80–89 %<br>**C** 70–79 %<br>**D** 60–69 %<br>**F** < 60 % – rumor |
| **Confidence** | **Certainty** we got the category right      | Same weights as Grade                                               | **High** ≥ 80 % – rock solid<br>**Medium** 50–79 % – plausible<br>**Low** < 50 % – big questions |
| **CAT Fit**    | **Narrative match** (Story Sentinel & Noise Neutralizer only) | 1–10 scale – how perfectly the story fits its bucket              | 10 = textbook example<br>1 = barely fits |

**Special rule (ANALYSIS bucket)**  
Models, studies, forecasts → **Grade capped at B**, **Confidence capped at Medium**  
Badge: **★ POLICY LENS: Derived Claim (Check Primaries)**

**Truth with heart.**  
You see the math.  
You decide the trust.  

## How ClarityGuard Works (3-Step Flow)

ClarityGuard always runs in this exact order — no shortcuts.

1. **Impact Shield first**  
   Any real-world hit? (people affected, dollars lost, roads closed)  
   → Cat 1–5 + **! EMERGENCY WARNING** if lives are at stake.

2. **Story Sentinel next**  
   No impact? Then it’s a story:  
   - POLITICS debates  
   - UNDERSTANDING deep dives  
   - ANALYSIS (models & studies) → **★ POLICY LENS**  
   - FUN connectors (memes, festivals) → **★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA!**

3. **Noise Neutralizer last**  
   Still no fit? It’s noise:  
   - JABBER · BLABBER · SOUR · MISC  
   → **★ MISLEADING** badge + “Suggest pre-post review”

One breath, one truth — every time.
